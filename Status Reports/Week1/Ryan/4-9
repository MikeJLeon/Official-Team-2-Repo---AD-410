Status Report 4/9:

Role: Project Lead

1) Made sure everyone understood the format for status reports

2) Checked in with group members if they were out of the loop or not responding

3) Looked at websites for concepts for the site
3.1) I found that a lot of sites looked campy and didn't really seem up to date.
3.2) Going with a more modern approach should appeal to the market
3.3) The lack of bootstrap in these sites was evident, they all seemed non-responsive
3.4) I enjoyed the color scheme of https://www.curiousworld.com/ and it had some components of our site
     The blog was particularly interesting
     
4) Started writing dates for individual project goals
