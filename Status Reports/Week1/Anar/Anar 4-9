Asked the team captain a direction where the backend team should go via Slack

Concluded that the backend team would be focusing on a potential email database submitted by perspective clients who sign up

Watched tutorial videos regarding how to set up and maintain an email database on a website

Did research on other websites which collected email addresses for a newsletter

Contacted other backend team member Dao regarding coming up with a specific plan on how to execute
