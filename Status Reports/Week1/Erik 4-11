I've been continueing to do research on other websites with a similar goal.
I've made a beginning shell of a website with html and css, which I will upload
  as soon as more is done with it.
  
Here is one of my favorite inspiration sites, which presents itself
  in a similar way to what is required (ie. not designed for kids, but for the adults that will be visiting the site).
