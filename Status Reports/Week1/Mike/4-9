1 - Talked to amy about whatever I found for blog, too much wordspace talk in google, need to probably find a better route or ask 
if its usable

2 - Ryan asked to find suitable websites to compare to, will look tomorrow

3 - Started to think about how to test the blog until we have a server to start uploading to

4 - Got my questions ready to ask the client
